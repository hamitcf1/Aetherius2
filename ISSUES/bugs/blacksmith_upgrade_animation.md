Bug: UI — Blacksmith Upgrade animation is broken


Steps to reproduce:

Click Equipment tab

Open Inventory button

Click on Blacksmith

Select an Item to upgrade from the Eligible Items section on the left side of the modal.

Click on Confirm Upgrade button.

Expected:

Smooth orange spark animation happens when successfully upgrading items each time.

Actual:

Upgrades happen but sometimes the animation is stuck. Animation is not smooth, sparks do not scatter and stuck inside the button, not moving.
