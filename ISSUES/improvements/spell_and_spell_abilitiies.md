Improvement: Spells and Spell abilities
Spells and Spell abilities are really affected by perks that are invested by the user. Please check everything related to this subject for bugfixes and errors that may be caused by accident. If a perk that says it gives bonus to fire damage and the user does not feel this difference when using fireball spell it will feel empty and game will not be good.
